# How to run project 

This project was developed in separate Java files and used the Visual Studio as an IDE.  If you plan to use this IDE, then just import this project and run the "ProcessScehduling.java" file. 

For other IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ, you may be required to create a blank project and copy and paste the files into the project. Please make sure to update any references to the "term-project-input.txt" file to ensure the data is loaded properly. 

# Project Abstract
This project was a term project to utilize concepts learned in the class and apply them in Java.  The **project_documentation.docx** outlines the problem and the necessary requirements to complete this project. Using PriorityQueue, we have to process multiple *Process* instances and ensure that these are handled by the code based on their priority and that the times are tracked properly. Metrics are printed after all *Process* instances are completely processed by the application.
